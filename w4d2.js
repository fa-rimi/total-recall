/**
 * 1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
 *      A: There are different ways to assign a value to a variable depending on the language. For JS specifically you would would
 *         declare the variable by combining a keyword and variable name. Then you would equal(=) it to the value. Values could be a 
 *         string, numbers, booleans, etc. 
 *      Ex: const hermione = "ron";
 * 
 * 2. How do we change the value of a variable?
 *      A: We change the value of a variable by using the assignment operator (=) 
 *      Ex: (SPOILER) let colossalTitan = "Bertolt";
 *          colossalTitan = "Armin";
 * 
 * 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
 *      A: We can assign an existing variable to a new variable using the assignment operator (=)
 *      Ex: let a = 5; 
 *          b = a;
 * 
 * 4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
 *      A: Declaring is declaring a variable with a keyword and variable name. (let a;)
 *         Assigning is to assign a value to said variable. (let a = "sighs";)
 *         Defining is telling the computer that there is a variable that exists with a specific value and type so the program can then
 *         proceed and compile.
 * 
 * 5. What is pseudo coding and why should you do it?
 *      A: Pseudo code is logically thinking and writing a "draft" of how you would solve a problem without writing actual code. It is
 *         an informal way of programming that doesn't require strict code and syntax. This is helpful because it you build a
 *         foundational understanding of the problem as well as an outline. At that point you just need to replace the outline with
 *         formal code.
 * 
 * 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
